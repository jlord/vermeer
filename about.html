          <p>I'm always searching for BBC history documentaries on YouTube and one day in 2015 I landed on one by Andrew Gahram Dixon on Vermeer in his series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-xGKQVrBdA" target="_blank"><em>The Secret Lives of Artists</em></a>. I was drawn to Vermeer's story and it was my first real exposure to much of his work.</p>

          <p>I really like the calm and architectural quality of his work. I watched and read more on him and as I was going to Amsterdam a month or so later I decided I'd visit the <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl" target="_blank">Rijksmuseum</a> and see some of Vermeers work first-hand.</p>

          <p>Seeing them first hand really sealed the deal for me. I loved going to a museum on my own, having a reason to push all the other works aside and sit and think about an artist and a few paintings.</p>

          <p>Because his known work is so limited it's very possible to see all of the (known) Vermeers—and I decided that I would. The details about each of my visits to see his work can be found on the <a href="visits.html">visits page</a>.</p>

          <p>I'm lucky in that my work and life allows me to travel and within a year I have seen two thirds of his work. My progress on the <a href="stats.html">stats page</a>.</p>

          <p>Finally, much of my visits and information has been fueled by the incredibly detailed site, <a href="http://www.essentialvermeer.com" target="_blank">Essential Vermeer</a>. I've read and enjoyed the following books:

          <ul class="tall-lines">
            <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vermeer-Art-Ideas-Wayne-Franits/dp/0714868795/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid=1463590068&sr=8-14&keywords=vermeer" target="_blank"><em>Vermeer (Art and Ideas)</em></a> by Wayne Franits</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9040090734?ie=UTF8&tag=theessnetialv-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=9040090734" target="_blank"><em>Vermeer at Mauritshuis</em></a> by Epco Runia (for Mauritshuis)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Site</h3>
          <p>I'm a web developer by day and enjoy making sites—how fun it is to build a simple site! The site's code is open and in a <a href="https://github.com/jlord/vermeer">repository</a> on GitHub, of course.</p>
